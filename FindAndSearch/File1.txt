I wasn't born deaf.  
I started losing my hearing at the age of 7 and became deaf in my 20's.
Now pushing 50 I have lived more years in silence than with sound. 
I do remember sounds, like the barking of a dog, the croak of a frog or the giggle of a child on a playground, 
but even those sounds in my mind are muted and I have no idea 
if the sounds I remember are truly what those sounds are like.
