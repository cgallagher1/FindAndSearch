I lay in bed the night before the fishing trip and thought it over, 
about my being deaf, about the years of not letting on I heard what was said,
and I wondered if I could ever act any other way again.
But I remembered one thing: it wasn't me that started acting deaf; 
it was people that first started acting like I was too dumb to hear or see or say anything at all.
